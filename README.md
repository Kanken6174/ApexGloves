# ApexGloves
This repository hold the arduino code for the ApexGlove V3.0, which is an open source vr glove project which does not use 3d printed parts.

This exact code is made for my ESP32S version of the glove, which still doesn't have a proper circuit diagram.

This glove is used in my soon-to-be-released dynamic steamvr driver project.
